# Wallpaper Archive

This is just a simple archive of wallpapers I've collected over the years. Resolution and subject are pretty haphazardly mixed. I've broken some of the files into resolution based directories. However, it's become clear to me that a screen ratio type of organization might work better.

## Dual Screens

There are a couple of directories for dual screen wallpapers that work on dual monitors in Windows if the wallpaper is set to tile. Resolutions are messed up and all over the place. For my current dual screen set up, the 3840x1200 directory is the best bet.

## 4k

There is a 4k directory, but not much is there as yet.

## 21:9

The 21:9 directory is for images that work on screens like the Dell U3415W 34" 21:9 screen. Tiling shouldn't be necessary.
